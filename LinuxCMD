REQUIRMENT - 

SOME LINUX COMMAND


             MONOLITHIC VS MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE - 

Lets Think about a Movie ticket Application -

PROCESS WE ALL FOLLOW -

GO TO UI

CONFIRMATON


MONOLITHICS - 
  In monolithics all the Compoent are tightly coupled
and all Comnucation are happen internal to the SYSTEM

Whereas In a microservice ARCHITECTURE all component are
Seperate basically you have user signin , ticket booking  
as a Seperate component.


So minimum  letancy in monolithics .Even though for microservices 
ARCHITECTURE you apply best practices and best paralism still there
is a minimum litancy which can be greater than monolithics Application. 



LANGUAGES FLIXIBILITY 

MONOLITHIC { WRITE CODE ON SINGLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE}
MICROLITHICS { FLEXIBILITY TO CODE EACH OF THE COMPONENT IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE}

SCALING 

MONOLITHIC - { monolithics ARCHITECTURE difficult to scale then MICROSERVICE in term of wastes of cpu resource utilization }
MICROLITHICS - { In MICROLITHICS its easy to scale }

DEPLOYMENT -
MONOLITHIC - monolithics applicaton take more times to deploy
MICROLITHICS - you can deploy its indivisual component on live production
               envirment.  

/// most organization and Company use MICROLITHICS ARCHITECTURE
