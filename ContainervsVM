CONTAINER VS VMS 


     FUNCTIONING PART IS DIFFERENT 

     Container they virtualize os instead of hardware.

     They abstract at app layer .
     They share host os 
     EAch app running in isolated envirment.
     TAKE less space


     VMS { VIRTUAL MACHINE SERVER}

     Provide abstraction of physical hardware

     Turning one partical server to different server 
     HYPERVISER- ItS just a software to allow us to create a vm.

     The role is allow host computer to support guest vm  
     each vm is literally a full copy of entire os
